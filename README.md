**Description**
Procrastination is a problem many people face, especially when tasks begin to pile up. It's easy for a simple to-do list to become an overwhelming mountain of tasks that causes panic. At this point it feels easier to keep procrastinating, and the cycle continues. Then when we try to get everything under control, we spend hours paralyzed by the simple task of figuring out where to start, only to realize we never completed anything. We end up sacrificing self-care needs such as taking breaks and eating just to try to stay afloat.
This pattern is faced by most people, whether in high school, college, or beyond. Our team wanted to address this issue by creating a solution that cuts down the pressure of choosing a task and helps users balance productivity with mental health. Productivity should not come at the expense of our own self-care and mental health. Instead, we need to balance them, and our website does exactly that.
Our website is a board-game themed, gamified to-do list. The game board presents a digital board game in which two players compete against each other to be the first to reach a set number of points, either 50, 100, or 150 points based on the players' selection. Each square on the digital board contains a self-care task. Before starting, the players each enter the tasks they need to finish, the due date, and intensity. Based on this, points are calculated for each task. After starting, a random task is selected for each player. After a player completes their task, they mark it as completed, receive points, and are able to roll the dice. The player's icon is moved to the corresponding square on the board, and the player is to complete the self-care task (take a 15-minute walk). Upon completion, the player is awarded points, and the next task is automatically selected. Unlike other "game-like" productivity apps, our website uses body doubling: because the players are completing tasks alongside each other there is a sense of accountability and friendly competition to complete tasks and self-care activities. In addition, the game chooses the tasks for the players, eliminating the initial time needed to choose a task. Because of the competition and the point incentives, players are motivated to complete their tasks as well as self-care.
