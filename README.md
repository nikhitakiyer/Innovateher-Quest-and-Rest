Game Rules

No trash-talking

Whoever reaches a certain # of points for the week wins. Each round is a week.

To start the game, you would invite someone to your game. They have to accept the invitation in order to start playing. You would then list out the tasks you have. This doesn’t have to be by week, because some people may have fewer assignments per week; they can just list the assignments they have until the foreseeable future and their due dates. Also, each task is weighted differently. If it's a simple assignment, it's not worth much compared to, like, a project, a long essay, a comprehensive assignment, or a lab report. 

Each player starts with 0 points and works their way up to reach the weekly points goal. 

Each player rolls a die, and wherever they land, a self-care card is selected

Description

This game is supposed to prevent procrastination. The players are incentivised through a board game-like to-do list. This is a two-player game set as a competition, with whoever reaches the set number of points first winning. Each week is a round. You earn points based on the depth of the assignment, and the assignments don’t have to be due that specific week; they can be due next week or later.
